# Cross-Platform BMI Calculator App Developed with React Native

The app I developed using React Native is a powerful BMI calculator that allows users to track their health and fitness progress. To clone the repository and access the app's code, follow these steps:

* Go to the Github repository page and click on the "Clone or download" button.

* Copy the repository's URL.

* Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

* Type "git clone" followed by the copied URL and press enter.

* Once the repository has been cloned, navigate to the project directory and run "npm install" to install all the necessary dependencies.

* Finally, run "npm start" to launch the app and start using it.

The app features a user-friendly interface and accurate calculations that allow users to monitor their BMI progress over time. Users can set goals, track their progress, and access helpful resources to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Using React Native to develop this app allowed for a seamless cross-platform experience, making it accessible to users on both iOS and Android devices. Overall, this BMI calculator app is a valuable addition to any health and fitness enthusiast's mobile device.

NOTE: I'm proud to showcase my first app in React Native, a BMI calculator that I developed with the help of a YouTube tutorial series. As someone who is relatively new to mobile app development, I found the series to be incredibly helpful in guiding me through the process of creating a cross-platform mobile app using React Native.

While there were certainly challenges along the way, such as learning how to properly structure components and troubleshoot issues, the tutorial series provided me with a solid foundation for building the BMI calculator app. Through trial and error, I was able to fine-tune the app's functionality and user interface, creating a reliable tool for monitoring one's BMI and health goals.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow through this project and to have a tangible app to show for my efforts. I hope that by sharing my experience with others, I can inspire more developers to take on new challenges and push themselves to learn new skills.
